# Decentralized Identity Across BLockchains

## Overview

This model presents decentralized identity based interoperability solution between two blockchains using the weaver interoperability framework. The framework provides a relay service that is deployed independently on the two blockchains to allow interoperability between them.
The model uses the hyperleger fabric and corda repository within weaver to deploy the both blockchains. The identity and verification contracts are deployed withing this blockchain and integrated with the framework
An experiment was conducted with the weaver framework to evalute the proposed model using metrics such as security, scalability, trust, transaction speed and transaction latency
The experiment was carried out using a VM with specifications of 16gb RAM, x64

The blochchains were deployed within a docker container
